    "### Exercise 1: Removing Duplicates and Handling Missing Values (SQL-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataset**\n",
    "- The dataset is located in the `hive_metastore.default.airbnb_open_data` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output**\n",
    "- Your output should be stored at: `hive_metastore.default.airbnb_open_data_copy`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Learning Objective**\n",
    "- Learn how to identify and remove duplicate entries and handle missing values in a SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Context**\n",
    "This exercise focuses on data cleaning, specifically identifying duplicate rows and handling missing values. Cleaning data is a crucial step in preparing datasets for analysis and ensures that insights are based on accurate, high-quality information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to be executed by the student:**\n",
    "1. Write a query to find and count duplicate entries based on `host_id`, `last_review`, and `list_id`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select only the latest review for each duplicate group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify missing values in `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Impute missing values in the `price` column with the average score of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise Question:**\n",
    "- After removing duplicates and imputing missing values, how many rows remain in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **End Goal:**\n",
    "- A clean dataset with no duplicates and no missing values in the `review_score` column.\n",
    "\n"
